# Dispense
A license management server

## About
This project is a service to store and dispense licenses to software as needed. Especially as new infrastructure is built.

## Why
While working with a mix of open source and paid software, I found a need to store and distribute licenses to new infrastructure. I also needed something that could alert me to one of my licenses expiring.
